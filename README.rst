Marius's .vim
=============

Instructions to self
--------------------

Clone it ::

    git clone https://gedmin.as/dotvim ~/.vim

Then install all the plugins (this'll be an interactive) and compile C
extensions (e.g. for Command-T) ::

    make -C ~/.vim


Instructions to other people
----------------------------

A common piece of advice given to new Vimmer is

    Don't put any lines in your .vimrc that you don't understand.

I completely agree with it.  Don't use other peoples' vim configs wholesale;
instead look at them, browse for ideas, then copy the interesting bits one by
one.
