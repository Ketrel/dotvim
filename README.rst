Marius's .vim
=============

Instructions to self
--------------------

Clone it ::

    git clone https://github.com/mgedmin/dotvim ~/.vim

If your vim is older than 7.3.1178, you'll also want to run ::

    ~/.vim/install.sh

Then install all the plugins (this'll be an interactive) and compile C
extensions for things like Command-T and YouCompleteMe ::

    make -C ~/.vim


Instructions to other people
----------------------------

Don't put any lines in your .vimrc that you don't understand.

Browse for ideas, copy interesting snippets.  One by one.
